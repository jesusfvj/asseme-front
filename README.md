# ASSEME - Frontend Application

ASSEME is a frontend application built with React, Vite, and Tailwind CSS. It allows users to register and upload GIFs and memes. Users can browse and view GIFs and memes without logging in, but they need to be logged in to upload new content. The application is connected to a MongoDB database, and backend requests are secured using JWT authentication. Axios is used for making these requests.

## Installation and Setup

Before running the ASSEME application, make sure you have Node.js and npm (Node Package Manager) installed on your machine. Additionally, ensure that you have a MongoDB database set up and running.

1. Clone the repository:

```shell
git clone https://github.com/your-username/asseme.git
```

2. Navigate to the project's root directory:

```shell
cd asseme
```

3. Install the dependencies:

```shell
npm install
```

4. Configure the front:

   - Open the `.envExample` file in the project's root directory and create a env.js file with the firebase keys updated.

5. Configure the backend:
